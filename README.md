# Gadget Galaxy - Client-Side

This is the client-side code for the Gadget Galaxy website, a platform focused on Technology and Electronics products. It includes features for user authentication, product management, and shopping cart functionality.

## Project Description

Gadget Galaxy is a website dedicated to technology and electronics enthusiasts. Here's what you can expect from our project:

- **User Authentication:** Our platform offers secure email and password-based registration and login. Additionally, users can log in using external accounts like Facebook, GitHub, or Google.

- **Homepage:** The homepage features a navigation bar, banner, and footer. It showcases at least six well-known technology brands, each with an image and name. Users can click on these brands to explore related products.

- **Add Product Page:** A private/protected route allows users to add products. The product form includes fields for an image, name, brand name, type, price, short description, and rating. Users can submit new products to the database.

- **Product Brand Pages:** Clicking on a brand redirects users to a page showcasing brand-specific products. Each product listing includes an image, name, brand name, type, price, rating, and buttons for viewing details and updating the product.

- **Product Detail Page:** Users can view detailed information about a product, and they have the option to add the product to their cart.

- **Shopping Cart:** A private/protected route allows users to view their added products. They can delete products if desired.

- **Update Product Page:** Users can update product information, including image, name, brand name, type, price, and rating. This is a private/protected route.

- **404 Page:** We've included a custom 404 page for handling not-found routes.
